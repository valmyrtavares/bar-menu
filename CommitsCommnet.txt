 Today theres is no way to log out of an anonymous client because the local storage of the phone is never cleaned and this has caused many bugs in the system. Lide the same cliente who was logged in as an anonyous one wants to switch to legal client and cannot. Now when the client record does not exist, the local storage of this phone is cleared and it is forwarded to login screen

 If was implemented a new feature about promotion

 It was implemented a new feature of voucher promotion. For now we have one button in the kitchen screen that show if the customer is or not a register client . If not the label of button is writed client if In the case when the customer is regitred the label is the name of the client. If is a client the employ can click and give the descont of voucher, just if it is a register client, else there is no descont to this customer Eech client just can participate one turn of this promotion. 

 It was created a eachCustomer component that show a sumary with all customer' s data and all dishes requested for him. In this screen still  is displayed the all requests's date done and the value of each one. This component stils this component still copy the phone number and anothers customer's data with one mouse click. The eachCustomer component is called inside of customerList component with one mouse click

 In this commit we already have all costs and prifits in the requestManagementModule and the final line is in table's bottom. For now all we have only total price selled and amont of products of day, There is no stil total cost and total profit. In many previus commits unfortunily theres os no commnets here and therefore it is a good idea talk about some features done. In current time of project we already have a popup with each product, showing costs, profits and prices of each item and the sums of all

 All totals params diplayed in screen of requestManagementModule component 

 it was implemented a colunm discount in our requestManagementModule component This data is grabed from voucherPromotion and calculate in showDiscountsVoucher function 

In the createCustomer component the input field birthday is a type-text and when it get focus the text keyboard turn avaiable to customer write your birthday date and it is not necessary use the defult windows keyboard that provided  one bad experience user 

In the requestModal component we have a popup called WarningMessages, inside it I created a ternary option that if the customer is anonymous, I load a new screen asking if he doesn't want to get a discount and then we have two buttons. Either he cancels and the flow remains the same and nothing changes or he clicks on the register button and I get all the items from his request and store them in the customer's local storage, clear the main userMenu in the local storage and send it to the create-customer component where he should register and that's all for now

The second part of this feature is complete. Now when the customer registers and returns to the system and he enters the order queue in the requestModal component, the system checks if there is a backorder in localstorage and loads it inside the backorder useState. And another useEffect with currentUser dependency is called. Remember that currentUser is the user id. When the currentUser is loaded, this useEffect calls updateingNewCustomer and passes the backorder useState as a parameter and the user receives the order items that were stored in localstorage and the flow continues. This new customer can come back to get new items or not. If he decides to finalize the order, the flow remains the same and since he is a new customer, the system allows the discount.

In the customerList component was implemented a delete button to each customer. It waw also implemented with the DefaultCommumMessage a warning due exclude customer

In the cusomer list screen that correspond to customerList component after delete some data, the screen is automatic updated

It was added the ExpensesManagementList component and it has a root adress to show data and i'll start development of its features

In this commit we finish the CRUD in ExpensesManagementList component with all is working

It was fixed a bug regarding the fields form which was never clear and always was filled. I add a new function in the button of open modal and in this function i change the obj sent to  null and therefore when i click in this button all the fields are empty and i also change the input type text to input type select in the form and I did some adjustments in style of this input

The totalExpensesValue function was implemented in the ExpensesManegementList component, which adds up all the values, both estimated and total, and places them in place of the screen button. In this case was used the generater html as a return of function with the data inside of it

it was done the selfFlowManagement component very similar to requestManagementModule. It select two dates and filter all orders just is between that two dates, after that this date is sended to TableComponent and it show de each item separeated, the order's price and the discount in each request. And in this tableComponent all total payments are separated in categories like cash, debit, credite, and pix with each total number

In the addExpensesForm component we added a new form to items with a lot of new fields. After filling them the system print a row of table with all data. This items are sent to DB within the main expense. In this approach we can have expenses with or without items. In case of payment of electric light or salary expenses there is no items in this casess
